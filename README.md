NFL Scheduling Project (OR 604) GMU

Hello,
These are all the assignment files for the Spring 2016 OR604 NFL scheduling problem.
If you are reading this you are either Dr. C (Hello Dr. C!) or you are one of
the team members. If you aren't, hello stranger! :)

This NFL scheduling challenge uses gurobi linear solver to build an optimized schedule for the NFL (2015) and will eventually have up to and maybe more than 50 constraints.
